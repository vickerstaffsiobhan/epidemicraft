For my dissertation in my final undergraduate year I created an epidemiological model in Minecraft. This model was a discrete SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model that showed the spread of a disease in a population.
To assess the value of this Minecraft model it was compared against a more traditional discrete SIR model created in Python
The code for this comparison model is here
Also here is code for a model used as a visual example of a SIR model
