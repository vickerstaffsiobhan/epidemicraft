# epidemicraft

For my dissertation in my final undergraduate year I created an epidemiological model in Minecraft. This model was a discrete SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model that showed the spread of a disease in a population.
The world file can be found here, which should allow for experiencing and experimenting with the models. The models are preliminary, therefore as more advanced models be develped they will be added
To assess the value of this Minecraft model it was compared against a more traditional discrete SIR model created in Python. 
The code for this comparison model is here. 
Also here is code for a model used as a visual example of a SIR model. To run these models I used code editor Spyder and it's Run function.
